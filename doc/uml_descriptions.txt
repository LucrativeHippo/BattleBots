Full umnl diagram description
The full uml diagram represents the culmination of the model, view and
controller sections of the architecture and shows how they interact with each
other. The view is perhaps the most separated of the 3 parts as it is accessed
only through the GameObserver interface and by the GameController. The
GameObseerver interface simply checks on the GamePanel whether the game is
over or not, and the GameController updates the view with its updated
information from the model which in turn updates the display. The Model also
is only accessed by the Controller, specifically the Game class is accessed by
the GameInfoProvider interface which passes it basic game creation
information, the GameControl interface, and the GameController which deals
with all user interactions and information updates to the Game class.
Game Controller uml diagram description
The Game Controller uml diagram is very simple as it simply contains the
GameController class and the three different interfaces that it implements,
ActionListener, KeyListener and GameObserver.
