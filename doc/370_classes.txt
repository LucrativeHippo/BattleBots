		HexSpace spaces[x][y]	
		
		
			
	Functions

		constructor(takes in the board size)

HexSpace(model)
	Attributes
		robotArray

	Functions
		none

The HexSpace class will be the individual hexagon spaces that make up the game
board.  Each space must be able to store a robot of any type (scout, sniper,
tank) in an array.  The amount of HexSpaces will be initialized by the
GameBoard Class. It includes the attributes isEmpty which will be true if no
robots are on the hex, and robotArray which is an array that contains every
robot on the hex.

The robot class will represent the basic robot type and will contain
attributes used for every robot subtype, including; the robots movement range,
attack range, shot damage, remaining movement left, the current direction it
is facing, if its the robots turn or not, the current directions dimension it is facing (whether it is 1,2 or
3 squares away depending on the range) and its current health value. It also
contains several important functions including; a basic create_robot function
that creates a robot object with attributes set to default values, it also
contains a getvalue function for each of its attributes allowing access to
each attributes value and a setvalue function for its health, direction,
direction dimension and movement allowing the values to be incremented.  

Each of the ScoutAI, SniperAI and TankAI classes extend the basic robot class
and will be the robot objects controlled by the games artificial intelligence.
They all have the four attributes movement, range, damage and health from the
basic robot class, but each is now set to the robot types default values. A
create function makes a new specific type robot with the appropriate attribute
values and additional AI functionality. The Shoot function deals the robots
attack damage to specific hex containing any number of enemy robots. The Move
function moves the robot to any square within its movement value as long as it
has movement left. The turn function increments the direction value by one

Each of the Tank, Scout and Sniper classes extend the basic robot class and
will be robot objects controlled by the human players. They also have the four
attributes movement, range, damage and health set to each robot types default
values.
