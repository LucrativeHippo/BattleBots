Cmpt 370 pair programming

For my first paired programming session I paired up with Mackenzie Power. We decided to work on the robot AI classes specifically focusing on the scan function. 
I had previously started on the scan function and was having problems getting it to work properly. It quickly became apparent that two eyes are better than one
as the problem was quickly found and solved. I found that the code written in the paired programming time had far fewer errors than usual, and was far more efficient.
While the code was better I do wonder if less actual code was written and work done in the alotted time. I believe that for more difficult problems paired programming 
proved to be very effective, but for the simpler tasks it seems like a waste of time as one person sits back with nothing to do.
