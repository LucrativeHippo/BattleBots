View Interface Testing
  The View is the outermost interface that interacts with the user.
It displays the GUI's for the game and interacts with the user by 
taking in input and sending that information to the controller. 
  
  The class TeamSelectionPanel, which is part of the View, also interacts 
with the Robot Librarian. The user will have the options of uploading 
and downloading robots from the Robot Librarian, as well as creating 
new robots, and editing existing ones. The TeamSelectionPanel is 
significant because the game cannot be played without being able to 
use robots from the Robot Librarian, and this is why it must be properly 
tested. The functionality will be tested in the Controller interface, 
but we will have to check visually that the proper information displayed 
in the GUI.

  The GamePanel class is also part of the View. It is responsible for 
drawing the state of the gameboard as well as the statistics on the side. 
It will redraw the gameboard when the updateGame function is called. 
This is a significant class for when the game involves human players so 
they can see an accurate state of the gameboard. We will visually check 
if the GamePanel displays the correct state of the board. 

  We have decided to add a new class to the design called 'Properties'. 
this class will store the information that the user inputs and the View 
will use it to instansiate the gameboard properly.

  Since we do not have the resources to properly test that these GUI's
properly display exactly as intened, we can only visually check them 
with our own eyes. When buttons are clicked, the controller will test 
the input and we will check if the GUI's behave proplerly. This is how 
most of the View interface will be tested.
