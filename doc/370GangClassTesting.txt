Since each Gang class will have a Scout, a Tank, and a Sniper, to test this class we require a mock robot.
The mock robot will need to have a field that will differentiate it from the others. This is important, as we
need to make sure that there is only one of each robot. Since there is only one of each robot, we will test that
there is exactly 3 robots per team.

The GangAI class is very similar to the Gang class. The main difference is that the GangAI class is for AI robots.
It is important that a GangAI class consists of only AI robots, so in the mock robot, there will need to be a field
that indicates if the robot is AI. The regular Gang class will have to make sure that it doesn't have any AI robots
