 
For my second pair programming session, I paired up with Mitchel. 
During the session we worked on mapping the mouse position to 
properly detect when the mouse is the bounds of a hexagon. After 
some time of trying to debug we pulled out a pen and paper to 
figure out and visualize what was happening. We found the task 
to be quite frustrating but by working with someone else I was 
able to stay focussed and on task much longer than if I were 
by myself. It was also helpful to has someone else's understandings 
of what is happening.
